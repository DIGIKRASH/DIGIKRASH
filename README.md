Hi! I am a mobile application developer creating user-friendly and intuitive interfaces. My primary focus is Flutter, although I also develop applications using React Native. Despite expanding my tech stack, Flutter remains my preferred choice whenever the project allows it. I also develop websites using Nuxt.js, which enables me to seamlessly combine mobile and web development, creating cohesive ecosystems. I pay special attention to code quality and maintainability, considering them core values of my work. Additionally, I am passionate about optimizing development processes: I create and improve project templates to ensure a quick start and simplify the integration of complex features. Ultimately, my goal is to build applications and websites that not only meet functional requirements but also bring joy to users through their convenience, thoughtful design, and flawless performance
