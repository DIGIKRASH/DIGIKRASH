## **I'm a Mobile Developer**

Hi! I specialize in developing mobile applications using Flutter, with a strong focus on creating intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces. Before diving into mobile development, I actively worked on building websites with Nuxt.js, which provided me with a solid background in web development. I emphasize clean, readable, and maintainable code, considering it one of the core values of my work. I am also passionate about optimizing the development process by creating and improving project templates with ready-to-use structures and features.
