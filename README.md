## **I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer** 

who specializes in creating high-quality web applications running on the client and server sides. My experience includes the development of both frontend and backend applications, which allows me to create full-fledged web services. I am attracted by the opportunity to constantly improve my skills and I am always ready to learn new things. My goal is to create web applications that are not only functional, but also aesthetically appealing.
